## Usage

```
usage: makelab [-h] [--output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [topology]

positional arguments:
  topology

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/larsks/kathara-makelab
```

## Description

The `makelab` command reads a YAML manifest and generates a `lab.conf` and associated `*.startup` files. This allows you to encapsulate a complete lab in a single file, making it easier to share with others.

## Examples

## Simple

The [`simple.yaml`](examples/simple.yaml) shows how to create a simple topology consisting of two hosts and a router.

```yaml
.INCLUDE examples/simple.yaml
```

## Featureful

The [`featureful.yaml`](examples/featureful.yaml) demonstrates most of the options available in a makelab manifest.

```yaml
.INCLUDE examples/featureful.yaml
```
